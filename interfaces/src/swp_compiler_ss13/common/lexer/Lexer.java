	 * If there are no characters left for tokenization it always returns a
	 * EOF-token.
	 * 
	 * For all minimal sequences of characters which are not matched by a
	 * token definition, the lexer returns these as NOT_A_TOKEN-tokens, eg:
	 * 3 + $$$$ 4 2w
	 * would result in:
	 * <NUM, '3'> <PLUS, '+'> <NOT_A_TOKEN, '$$$$'> <NUM, '4'> <NOT_A_TOKEN, '2w'>
	 * 
	 * Note that whitespaces are ignored but are essentially for token split. 
	 * This means '2w' may not be parsed as <NUM, '2'> <ID, 'w'>.
